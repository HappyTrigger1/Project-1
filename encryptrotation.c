//Rotation Cipher (Caesar Cipher)
//Rotates letters ONE shift cross. i.e. a = b, b = c.....
//Encrypt: how are you
//Decryption: gnw bqd xnt
//e(m) = (m + k)(%26)    function required for encryption of message. 
//d(c) = (c âˆ’ k)(%26)    function required for decryption of message.
//m is the message, k is the key shift. 
//e(m) is used to encrypt a message.
